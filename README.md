# Landlord-App
Just like the name 'Landlord-App' suggests ,it is an application that is to be used  by Apartment/Land Owners to save ,edit and extract tenants records and details.It utilizes various modules like SQLITE3 module that I have used to create the database and the TKINTER module to create GUI .
I created it out of necessity since my Parents are Landlords of ,'Serene Apartments' in  Juja Kiambu County , and required an Application that easens the work of keeping track of the Apartments bills and Tenants houses and because I had Studied a short course on Python programming ,I took it upon myself to create the Application which I named LandLord App.
Its User-friendly indeed.
